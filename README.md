### Purpose
In this assignment, we will use a powerful data visualization too: Tableau to find some business  insights from a large data set of bike riding recordings. In this initial raw dataset, some valuable information are recorded: for each ride, we are given the the starting location, end location, duration of riding, gender of user starting time and ending time, etc. We can use these valuable information to find the geographical areas that has the most riders to bike and find the period of time that has the most number of active rider in a day or in a weekday. This precious information can help us to figure out our customer group and determine business strategy and marketing plan based on the potential customer group

### Insights 
## Checkout Times for Users
In this graph, we can easily find out that the most number of ride is 4-5 hours 
![1]()

## Checkout Times for Gender
in this graph, we can find that for female and unknown gender, the hours of ride is steadly the same; however, for the male, the hour of ride is slowly climbing to 4-6 hours as the most number; then gradually decrease after 6 hours

## Trips by Weekday per Hour
in this graph, the stronger the colour is, the more number that area has. in this case, we can easily identify that Thursday from 5 pm to 6 pm is the period that has most of the people

## Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) 
in this graph, the number of ride is shown as the same logic as the previous graph. From the colour of the graphs, we can find out that male rider has generally more ride than the female.

## User Trips by Gender by Weekday
In this graph, we can find out the in general, the subscriber group has more ride than the customer group. And the male subscriber has more ride than the female rider in general

## Top Starting Locations
We can easily find out in which location the users are frequently starting their bike, which means we can use this graph to easily find which area has the biggest potential to discover the customer
![6]()

## Top Ending Locations
We can easily find out in which location the users are frequently ending their bike, which means we can use this graph to easily find which area has the biggest potential to discover the customer

### Summary

According to the above graphs, we can have the following insights

1) Males has more number of user than the female. The target customer group can be designed as males groups. 

2) The peak period of riding  during the weekend is Thursday 4-6 pm.

3) Most users ride for 4-5 hours 

### Two additional suggestions
I will think to add “minutes” into our graph for ‘tripduration’ will be better as it will provide more precise insights.

I will think if we can add a top 10 latitude and longitude user will be better as it will provide us the location of areas that have the most active users.
