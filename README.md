### Purpose
In this assignment, we will use a powerful data visualization too: Tableau to find some business  insights from a large data set of bike riding recordings. In this initial raw dataset, some valuable information are recorded: for each ride, we are given the the starting location, end location, duration of riding, gender of user starting time and ending time, etc. We can use these valuable information to find the geographical areas that has the most riders to bike and find the period of time that has the most number of active rider in a day or in a weekday. This precious information can help us to figure out our customer group and determine business strategy and marketing plan based on the potential customer group

### Insights 


### Summary

According to the above graphs, we can have the following insights

Males has more number of user than the female. The target customer group can be designed as males groups. 
The peak period of riding  during the weekend is Thursday 4-6 pm.
Most user ride for 4-5 hours 

### Two additional suggestions
I will think to add “minutes” into our graph for ‘tripduration’ will be better as it will provide more precise insights.
I will think if we can add a top 10 latitude and longitude user will be better as it will provide us the location of areas that have the most active users.
